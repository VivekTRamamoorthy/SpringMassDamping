# Spring mass systems with different damping loss factors

This is a web demonstration for gaining an intuition for the viscous damping loss factor in mechanical vibration.

Damping loss factor is the ratio of damping coefficient C with the critical damping coefficient.

The demo can be accessed at [VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io/SpringMassDamping](https://VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io/SpringMassDamping)

One can drag the masses and release them using their mouse or using touch in mobiles. The response of the masses are then computed using Javascript and the masses are moved on the canvas.
